## 1. Purpose and background

Generate printable QR-code stickers for Peakbook check-in. Each QR code encodes a deep-link URL to `https://peakbook.app/scan?token=…` (20 char uppercase alphanumeric). Sticker includes QR code, central logo overlay, and a configurable caption. Stickers will be printed professionally.

---

## 2. Goals and success criteria

**Goals:**

1. Single-page web tool (static or SPA) for staff to generate a QR-sticker from a single token and caption.
2. Generate a ready-to-print SVG sticker file containing QR, logo, and caption.
3. Support future extension for batch generation of multiple stickers.
4. Deep-link behavior: if the Peakbook mobile app is installed, the QR should open the app; otherwise fallback to a download/instructions or web-continuation page.
5. Caption is configurable and embedded on the sticker.
6. Tool should be simple, minimal-dependency, usable offline or hosted.

**Success criteria:**

- QR stickers scan reliably after professional printing.
- Deep link opens the app when installed (if universal/app links are configured), otherwise falls back correctly.
- Staff can generate a printable single-sticker SVG in under 10 seconds.
- Future batch mode can generate dozens of stickers per minute.
- Caption legibility verified at 5 cm sticker size.

---

## 3. Scope

### In-scope

- UI form for single-token mode: token input, caption input, “Generate” button.
- Fixed base URL `https://peakbook.app/scan`, configurable query parameter name (“token”), configurable caption.
- QR generation with embedded SVG logo overlay in the center.
- SVG layout sized for a 5 cm × 5 cm sticker (round or rounded-corner square).
- Caption text placed in the sticker SVG, under the QR code, centered.
- “Download SVG” button that outputs a print-ready vector sticker file.
- “Print” button to test‐print (office printer) or preview.
- Minimal styling using either TailwindCSS (if easy) or simple CSS (YAGNI).

### Deferred / future

- Batch generation mode (CSV or list of tokens/captions → printable sheet layout).
- PNG export fallback.
- Multiple stickers per sheet (grid layout).
- Mobile-optimized UI for running on tablets or phones in field.
- Dark-background QR variant or alternate brand colors.

---

## 4. Deep-link and fallback behavior

- QR payload: `https://peakbook.app/scan?token=XXXXXXXXXXXX`
- Ideal flow: mobile OS detects domain association (Universal Links on iOS, App Links on Android) and opens the native Peakbook app directly. ([axon.dev][1])
- Fallback: if the app is not installed or the link-association is missing, the `/scan` web route should deliver a fallback page with download instructions or “continue in web” logic.
- Requires hosting domain-association files: `apple-app-site-association` for iOS, `assetlinks.json` for Android, and configuring the app accordingly. ([Stack Overflow][2])
- If domain association isn’t set up yet, consider a redirector page or web‐to‐app logic as a fallback.

---

## 5. Sticker layout and size

- Sticker shape: 5 cm × 5 cm, either round die-cut or square with rounded corners.
- QR size: target \~4–4.5 cm across to maximize scan reliability, leaving margins.
- Use bleed and safe margins: add a 2–3 mm bleed or margin in the SVG to accommodate professional printing tolerances and trimming. ([Stickiply][3])
- Caption: text placed in the SVG below the QR, horizontally centered. Keep caption at least 3 mm away from edge of sticker and bleed area (safety zone). ([Custom Sticker Print][4])
- Logo overlay: ≤ 25% of QR width, centrally placed, with high error correction (ECC level “H”) to ensure scanability despite occlusion.

## 6. Functional requirements

| ID    | Requirement                                                                                            |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| FR-1  | Token input field: restrict to length=20 and characters \[A-Z0-9]                                      |
| FR-2  | Caption input field: free text, editable, default value (“Scan to check-in” or similar)                |
| FR-3  | Base URL fixed to `https://peakbook.app/scan`, configurable query parameter name (“token”)             |
| FR-4  | “Generate” button builds URL: `https://peakbook.app/scan?token=…`                                      |
| FR-5  | Generate an SVG sticker: outer canvas sized for 5 cm × 5 cm plus bleed margin                          |
| FR-6  | Place QR code in center of sticker SVG, with embedded logo overlay                                     |
| FR-7  | Set high error correction level (“H”) and limit logo size to ≤ 25% QR width                            |

---

## 7. Non-functional requirements

- Fully client-side tool (browser only). No server backend needed for the single-token generation path.
- QR library must support SVG output, logo overlay, and export of complete SVG.
- Sticker output must be vector (“SVG”) for professional print services.
- Bleed/safety margins must meet print shop norms (e.g. \~3 mm). ([Stickiply][3])
- Caption legibility must be tested at intended sticker output at print size.
- High contrast QR (dark color on light background) to maximize scan reliability.
- Keep dependencies minimal. Prefer static HTML/JS bundle with optional TailwindCSS.
- Performance: generation should complete within a few seconds for a single sticker.

---

## 8. User workflow

1. Staff opens the QR-sticker generator web page.
2. UI shows:
   - Token input (20 chars, uppercase alphanumeric)
   - Caption input (editable)
   - Fixed or configurable query parameter name (“token”)
   - “Generate” button
   - “Download SVG” button
   - “Print” button or print preview link

3. Staff enters/pastes the token.
4. Staff edits the caption if needed.
5. Staff clicks “Generate”. The UI displays a preview of the sticker (embedded SVG or rendered preview).
6. Staff clicks “Download SVG” to get the vector artwork ready for professional sticker printing.
7. Staff optionally does a quick “Print” to test layout on office printer and verify scan behavior and caption placement.
8. Staff submits SVG to the professional sticker printer.
9. Staff receives printed sticker, affixes it, tests QR with mobile phone to verify that the link opens the app or fallback as expected.
10. In the future, staff can use a batch mode generating multiple sticker SVGs or a printable sheet of sticker layouts from a list of tokens and captions.

## 9. Risks and mitigation

| Risk                                                               | Mitigation                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Deep link fails to open app if domain association isn’t configured | Ensure Universal Links (iOS) and App Links (Android) are configured with the domain association files (`apple-app-site-association`, `assetlinks.json`) and app entitlements are set. ([Stack Overflow][2]) |
| QR density too high or sticker too small → scan failure            | Enforce a minimal QR physical size (\~4 cm on a 5 cm sticker), limit token length (20 chars), use high error correction, test prints.                                                                       |
| Logo overlay breaks readability                                    | Limit logo size to ≤ 25% QR width, use ECC “H”, test printed codes under real conditions.                                                                                                                   |
| Print trimming introduces white borders or mis-cut                 | Include a bleed margin (\~2–3 mm) and keep all important content (QR modules, caption) inside a safety zone at least 3 mm from trim line. ([Stickiply][3])                                                  |
| Printer rejects the SVG file format                                | Confirm printer accepts SVG vector files. If not, provide fallback PDF export or a rasterized high-resolution export (later).                                                                               |
| UI complexity from Tailwind installation                           | Evaluate early whether Tailwind can be imported as a CDN style bundle or whether plain CSS is simpler for this small tool.                                                                                  |
